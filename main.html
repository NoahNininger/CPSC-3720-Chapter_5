<!--
   In this project, you will create a math multiplication table using loops.
   You can do this using your own creativity or by following some of the 
   following suggested steps:

      1. Set up a blank array to contain the final multiplication table.

      2. Set a value variable to specify how many values you want to multiply
         with one another and show the results for.

      3. Create an outer for loop to iterate through each row and a temp array
         to store the row values. Each row will be an array of cells that
         will be nested into the final table.

      4. Add an inner for loop for the column values, which will push the
         multiplied row and column values to the temp array.

      5. Add the temporary row data that contains the calculated solutions 
         to the main array of the final table. The final result will add a 
         row of values for the calculations.
